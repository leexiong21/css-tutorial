Things I liked about the article-
The article was good and had many styles of CSS such as; the drop down menu, animation, image effect, and 3D flat bottom. 
It was interesting to read about. I took away some new information to help me in the futrure. Taking in this knowledge will
be very benefical to me. The article gave me lots of new ideas I didn't think about before. It was informative and had
interesting ways to create and change different things. Also, it was visually appealing and had a nice color scheme and 
creative layout to it. 

Things I didn't like about the article- 
Even though this article listed a variety styles we can learn to utilize, the way it was worded can confuse some people. 
Re-writing a few of the instructions to make it more concise and clear will help with any confusion. Also, some of the styles 
did not have a valid code. I tried a few of the styles that I liked and checked them with the W3C Validators. I discovered some 
mistakes that needed to be fixed. However, overall it was a great website and can be very helpful to anyone that needs to use it.
